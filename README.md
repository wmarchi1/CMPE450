This repo contains the code used in the Intelligent Convoy System capstone for CMPE450/451. This repo is a joint effort between the Communication and Controls team and the Obstacle Avodance Team. The focus of the CC system is to generate control signals for driving and steering the vehicles as well as creating a communication protocol between lead and follower vehicles. The focus of the Avoidance team is to ensure that the follow vehicles safely avoid obstacles in an autonomous fashion while following the lead vehicle path
